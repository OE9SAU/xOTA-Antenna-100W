# xOTA-Antenna-100W
**A pcb for a 100W Fnd Fed Half Wave Antennas (EFHW) for SOTA, POTA,... xOTA** <br /><br />

Based on my xOTA-Antenna Design (https://github.com/DG1JAN/xOTA-Antenna) I made an updated Version with a better Toroid for higher power (100W SSB) and lowe core losses.

## BOM (1:56 UnUn for EFHW)
1x PCB: custom order with Gerber Files from PCB manufacturer e.g. from https://www.jlcpcb.com 

1x Toroid - FairRite 2643101902 (DigiKey is a good source)

1.6m of Trafo wire - e.g. BLOCK	CUL 1mm

1x BNC Socket -e.g-  Amphenol B6252H7 / Telegärtner J01001A0038 (or similar) 

1x Plastic Wedge (3D Print Part, STL is in the Repo,use PETG) https://github.com/DG1JAN/xOTA-Antenna-100W/blob/main/xOTA_100W_Wedge_DG1JAN.stl

1x Cable Tie 2.5mm wide, 150cm long

1x 100pF  Ceramic Capaciator - e.g. TDK CC45SL3FD101JYVNA (DigiKey is a good source)

2x 4mm Banana Socket* - e.g.	GTIWUNG	4mm Plug from Amazon

9cm Shrink tube - 85mm wide


optional:

1x S-Hook Carabiner for wire straun relief and easy mountung

1x 3D-Printed Coil Holder ( a small coil of 10Windings ~1m from the UnUn in the Antenna Wire results in a better match of 40 & 20m Band) [https://github.com/DG1JAN/xOTA-Antenna-100W/blob/main/xOTA_100W_Wedge_DG1JAN.stl](https://github.com/DG1JAN/xOTA-Antenna-100W/blob/main/EFHW_Coil_DG1JAN.stl)

*alternativ mountting Option for Antenna Wire (2x 4mm Banana Sockets are not requierd):
- use M3 Screw and Wing nut
- solder Wire directly
